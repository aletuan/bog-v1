> JSON We bTokens - [JSON Web Tokens - jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) is an open, industry standard RFC 7519 methods for representing 	claims securely between two parties as JSON object.  

## Structure
JSON Web Token consist of three sections separated by the dot (.):

	* Header
	* Payload (`Claims`)
	* Signature

Let go into the details content  of each sections

### Header

The header typically includes two parts: the token type (which is JWT), and the hashing algorithm being used (such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA).

For example:

```js
	"alg": "HS256",
	"typ": "JWT"
}
```

Then this header is encoded by `Base64Url` to become another value:

```js
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9
```

### Payload

This section contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (for example, user information - id, name, email) and additional data.  

There are three types of claims: *registered, pubic and private claims*. Note that the claims name are only three characters long.

An example of payload including only private claims:

```js
{
   "sub": "1234567890",
   "name": "John Doe",
   "admin": true
}
```

The payload is also Base64Url encoded as same way as header encoding.

### Signature

The signature is used to verify the message wasnâ€™t changed along the way. If signature is signed with a private key, it can also verify the identity of JWT sender.

To create the signature, we take the encoded header and encoded payload, a secret key, and the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.

```js
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret)
```
